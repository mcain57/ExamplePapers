This is all just Newton’s Second Law, $F = ma$: we want no acceleration, so the (vector) sum of the forces $F$ must be zero. To apply this in practice, we need to decide which part of the universe, which mass $m$, we are talking about.

Whilst one member of your lab group adjusts the turnbuckle, another member will take photos to record all gauge readings, making sure to include the Bar 1 reading in the shot.  You will then be able to determine all bar forces in terms of the force in bar 1, and knowing the total weight of the loaded pan, the simple statics of the lever arm will allow you to convert the electronic strain gauge readings into bar forces in Newtons (more about this later).\n"
